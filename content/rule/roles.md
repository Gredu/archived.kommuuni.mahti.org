Form of government in the Community is responsibility based. Most of us have own section of the house which they will govern. They can make new rules for those section.

A person governs everything what happens in the section they are assigned to. **This really means everything**, but it doesn't mean you have to do everything! You could set rules to help your responsibilities.

*If you have to melt the freezer, one who governs kitchen has to be one who watch over it, and make sure it is being done. If lamps are broken in the living room, the one who governs the public are has to make sure that it'll be fixed. If there is a mold in the ceiling of shower room, the one who is governs shower rooms and toilets has to make sure it will get cleaned.*

Areas that are governed:

  - Shower room and toilet - {{< role toilets >}}
  - Public area and the floor of kitchen - {{< role public >}}
  - Kitchen, but not the floor of kitchen - {{< role kitchen >}} 
  - Meta - {{< role leader >}} *Means Community Bank, "recruiting", property conferences, paperworks, documentation, rules for rulers, all bills, substitute etc.*

Windows do not belong to anyone.

*Reason why one who governs the public area has also the kitchen floor is because it is easier and more clean to vacuum everything. Leaving some floors unclean just makes dirts go from one room to other.*

**Every resident should work for at least 1.5 to 2 hours a month for the area you are governing.** *This is actually very little. In normal house it is more than 3 hours of house work.* If you work less than 1.5 or more than 2 hours a month, you should report it to **Greatman**. Don't overwork and don't do too little.

{{< role general >}} is currently not governing anything, but he gets monthly task.

Remember that governing something doesn't mean you actually have to do everything. If you feel that someone is culprit for something you can make him or her to clean up or fix it. You can also set new rules to help you to keep your area clean. {{< role general >}} is also free to use if there is something you need to get clean, but your time (the two-hour per month) is running out.

You should feel that the area you are governing is your kingdom. Make rules and make it more efficient.

Aside from the work that comes from your role, there are also [common tasks]({{< ref "/rule/common-tasks.md" >}}). Those tasks are so small that they are not counted to your work hour. **if the common task is in your area of govern, you have to make sure that other and you are carrying that task.**

If you are out for vacations more than two weeks, {{< role general >}} or {{< role leader >}} will take your place temporarely. Temporaly substitution doesn't include responsibility though, just a regular cleaning.

## What if I'm lazy and I have trillionz of money?
You can hire someone to handle your responsibilities, but you need to find that person yourself. You will also have to look over him or her that she or he actually carries his or her duty. You can not get someone in the Community to take care of your responsibilities, because he or she would be overworked.

Minimum wage is 20 â‚¬ per month.

You can't buy yourself out from the [common tasks]({{< ref "/rule/common-tasks.md" >}}).
