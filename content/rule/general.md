## Silence

Three things happens after 10 pm:

### Washing machine
Washing machine has to be off at 10 pm. *It may annoy our neighbors.*

### Declaring silence
After 10 pm, anyone can declare silence. If no one is declaring silence there will be no silence, but silence enough that we don't bother our neighbors. Our neighbors seem to be very permissive of our noises though.

If anyone declares the silence at or after 10 pm, she or he has all the right to do so. No hard feelings. He or she may declare it beforehand too.

### Mild silence
After 10 pm you should be aware that some might be sleeping. **Don't slam doors if someone is sleeping.** If you don't see a light in one's room after 10 pm, you can assume, that he or she is sleeping.

Use your common sense to realise what area of the house you should be more silent. Here is some guideline:

If **Suvi** is sleeping, use shower room for toilet needs instead of the small toilet.

If **Filmon** is sleeping, don't watch movies in the living room or have lights open too long in the vestibule.

If **Greatman** and/or **Anshul** are sleeping, be more gentle with the shower room door.

Rooms are quite good at isolating noises. **Worse are the noises that comes from slamming the doors!**

## Dishes
You are not allowed to store unclean dishes in the kitchen. If you are unable to wash your room right away, take them to your own room.

*You should see your own dirty dishes daily. It motivates you to wash them. It is too easy to forget your dishes to the kitchen. Also, someone else's dishes annoy more than your own dishes.*

An exception to these rules applies only if you are with your friends. Only then you may leave unclean dishes for a short time.

## Special rules
Special rules overwrites normal rules. Names and reasons are written, so we know when to purge the rule when it becomes unnecessary. There is also a high possibility that those rules become permanent at some point. If that happens, then reasons and names can be then erased.

There are currently no special rules.
