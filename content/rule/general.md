## Silence
Washing machine has to be off at 10 pm. *It may annoy our neighbors.*

After 10 pm anyone can declare silence. If no one is declaring silence there will be no silence, but silence enough that we don't bother our neighbors. Our neighbors seems to be very permissive of our noises though, so until further notice, have fun.

If anyone declares the silence at or after 10 pm, she or he has all the right to do so. No hard feelings. He or she may declare it before hand too.

## Dishes
You are not allowed to store unclean dishes in the kitchen. If you are unable to wash your room right away, take them to your own room.

*It takes longer time to wash your dishes, if you don't see it daily and if it is not on the location that bother you. It is too easy to forget your dishes to the kitchen. Also other's dishes annoy more than your own dishes.*

An exception to this rules applies only if you are with your friends. Only then you may leave unclean dishes for a short time.

## Special rules
Special rules overwrites normal rules. Names and reasons are written so we know when to purge the rule when it becomes unnecessary. There is also a high possibility that those rules become permanent at some point. If that happens, then reasons and names can be then erased.

**Firehiwet** specific rules set by **Greatman**:

  - 10 pm is absolute silence, always **Firehiwet** *has enormously fickle time scheduled due her work and social circle, so it is hard to know when she'll be home and what she'll be feeling*
  - You can use fireplace only on special event *Noise of the fireplace vacuum annoys her*
