There are lots of places you can store your stuff. Actually the whole house is a one big storing area... Just make sure that you store right item to a right place.

Any item found in the public area is free to use. For small cheap things you don't need to ask permission, but do return it back. If you can't return it, report it missing, and we'll see how you can compensate.

**Do make clear distinction what are items that are worth storing and what are trash.**

## Warehouses
We have two warehouses. One is actually an old walk-in wardrobe, but we call it a small warehouse. Another is a cellar warehouse.

### Small warehouse
Any consumable found in the small warehouse is free to use. Any item in the warehouse should be free to use. Owner of an item can make some restriction though.

Store your stuff in the small warehouse only if you use that item often. You can also store seasonal objects if you use them a lot.

**Currently small warehouse has an ongoing cleaning, so there might be some stuff you are not allowed to use! Ask in the group chat if you are unsure.**

All public laundry is also stored in the small warehouse.

### Cellar warehouse
Store anything that you rarely use. *eg. traveling bag*

You can get key to the cellar warehouse from **Greatman**. *Key used to be free to take at anything from the vestibule desk, but it caused a mess.*

## In house
You can have items around the house if they are items you use daily or items that anyone can use. Item has to be used often to gain permission to be in the public area. You also need to think of the aesthetic. That is why dirty dishes are not allowed in public area even if you use that dish daily. Unclean dishes can be in kitchen, but only if they are waiting to be cleaned. **Do not store dishes in the kitchen**. Read more from [general rules]({{< ref "/rule/general.md">}}).

Every resident has their own private slots in shelfs, freezer and refrigerator. If owner of a slot is not defined, it is free to use. Everything inside non defined slot is FFA if it doesn't have a name tag.

### Vestibule
Vestibule has a special role as a room. There you can store your stuff temporary. **Every stored object in vestibule has to have a plan** when they are moved. **Vestibule is a staging area.**

### Living room's table
All fruits can be stored in the living room in their own plate. Everyone owns their own plate, so no tags needed.

### Kitchen table
Everything in the kitchen table is FFA.
