## Laundry
Dirty public laundry are located in the shower room. Everything in the dirty basket is a public laundry and should be washed in 60 Celsius. If you can't get the washing machine full, fulfill with public laundry. It is a good way to make it full and be more [green]({{< ref "/guide/green-and-recycling.md" >}}).

Green carpet in the shower room should be washed in 40 Celsius.

## Kitchen sheet
If you feel that the sheet of the kitchen table is dirty, you can change it. Just take it to the public laundry basket in the shower room and get the new one from the house warehouse. It is located just right when you get in.

**Don't dine on top of bare table without a sheet. Don't be lazy. Just change the sheet if it feels dirty.**

*Peeling the sheet little so that the bare table is exposed so you can use the cleaner base is extremely stupid, lazy and mentally retarded. It means that you know that it is unclean, but you don't want to do anything to it, even when it requires very little of effort.*

## Garbages and recycles
Emptying recycles and garbages is easy. Just take it to the vestibule. Next who leaves gets to take them out. 

*It seems to be hard to define what garbages or recycles are full. A good rule of thumb is that garbage is full if you can't throw anything to it without it falling down. However, don't do it in the opposite way! Don't put your trash carefully on the pile so it will not fall and just think that is not yet full (Seen that done!). Also, the trashes in toilet and shower room are full, if it is more easy to leave stuff on top of the flap rather than putting it inside.*

### Bio
There is a duty roster on the refrigerator door. If you see a blue mark in your name, it is your turn to take bio. When you are done, move the mark to the right. If you are not able to move it the right, put it to the most left (forming a loop). When you move your mark to next person, but you see a red mark, remove it, or one of them if there are many, and skip that person.

If you see that bio is full, but it is not your turn, you can still take the bio. If you do, put a red mark on your name so other know to skip you next time and remove your mark. You can have many red mark.

If bio looks dirty, you should wash it after you have emptied it.

## Drying dishes
If you don't have room to dry your dishes, then you have to empty the drying area.

*It is actually not that time-consuming to do it. Usually it feels hard, because you don't know where to put dishes. They are usually in a very logical location and in easy reach. Perhaps just few steps away.*

*We usually take care of our own stuff, but this is exception. It might not feel fun to empty someone else's dishes from the drying area, but this way, you don't have to put a timer for yourself when to empty the drying area. Setting a timer is more nuisance.*

It is good idea to take new plates, forks, knifes etc. from the drying area, so we don't fill them too quickly.

## Refilling hand and dish soaps
Refill hand soaps and dish soap when they are empty. Hand soap can be found from the living room and dish soap is in the vestibule. *Will be moved to kitchen shortly after some cleaning is done.*

## Common sense
Common sense is never written here, but are shouted in the group chat. *eg. if there are one toilet paper left in the shower room, you should get more. Don't play roulette with toilet*

Of course, common sense can sometime be very hard to reason because of cultural differences. If that is the case they'll be written here or to the [general]({{< ref "/rule/general.md">}}) rules.
