Community of Kontula is a home for five residents. Our diversity is high. We have people with very different cultures and backgrounds. This has been very richening experience, although it has brought up some very interesting challenges. It might be very hard to know what behaviors are cultural and what are personal. Therefor setting right rules is not always an easy task.

This web page is an attempt to get residents to understand these differences and help them integrate more easily to the community and to the Finnish society. Also, some residents are living alone from their parents for the first time. There are lot to learn, so a hub of information that is easily accessible is needed. This webpage is made to fullfil that need.

## Goal
Community of Kontula has two main goals for its residents:

  - Wellbeing of a single person
  - Wellbeing of Community as a group

These two rules are equally important. Balancing them is hard and they can contradict. Also, for some person "wellbeing" can mean different things.

To achieve our goals, we have chosen that the form of government in our Community is based on responsibilities. Each resident is given a responsibility and ability to make rules. We try to keep rules minimum, and we trust more of one's own morale and ethic. This will hopefully also strengthen the trust between residents.

## We are green
Every resident in community is obligated to be green. This means recycling and moderate usage of water and electricity. More in [Green and Recycling]({{< ref "/ohje/ekologisuus-ja-kierratys.en.md" >}}) section.

## Reasoning and common sense
Everything written in *italic* is usually an explanation. You don't have to read them if you just agree to follow the rules without breaking them. You can break the rules if you understand the reason why the rule exist, and by breaking the rule, you don't actually break the fundamental reason of why that rule exist. More of this in psychology section.

It is recommended to read explanations and take some time thinking them. You could actually come up with better rule. Every rule has a reason to exist. Your life can get more easy if you know when to break the rules.

## Recommended read order

Read all **Rules**. Only read **Guides** if you need some help or someone has implicitly referred you to. You should read psychology though.
