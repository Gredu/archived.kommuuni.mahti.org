If something essential for living breaks, the land lord will not buy a new one. Instead, each resident will buy that object together and everyone will get a share of it (20%). When a resident moves out, the new resident who moves in has to buy the share.

Each month, the share will drop 2% from the total amount of how much it costed. In 50 months the object will be own by the community again. Notice that the 2% is a stacking. It is a simple calculation: first month 2%, second month 4%, third month 6% etc.

*The drop by 2% is basically to make community properties intact. If community is dissolved, all objects that were in the house should exist. Also, by reducing 2% per month, it will reduce the cost of new resident to move in, when they have to buy shares. And buying an old objects as if it was new is very unfair.*

*Imagine a situation where refrigerator, freezer, oven, micro, etc. were broke, and everything is bought by residents. If there was no reducing and a new resident comes in, he or she would have to pay full price for everything, and no object would ever be a community property anymore.*

Land lord will buy all shares if community is dissolved.

Table shows the individual's price of the share. This is the price resident will get, when she or he leaves and the price that new resident has to pay. *Table is not done yet!*

## Washing machine
Washing machine was bought in January 2016. Price was 299.0 €.

## Freezer
Freezer was bought in June 2019. Price was 555.89 €. Price will start dropping in July.

## Toothbrush

Toothbrush was bought voluntarily. Those who owns a share can use it. Currently owners are **Greatman**, **Arto** and **Filmon**. You may become a user if you buy a share from these shareholders.

When share is reduced to 0 €, community will not take ownership of the toothbrush. As long as community exist, it will be in community. If community is dissolved, toothbrush will be auctioned.

You may never restrict the usage of toothbrush from the community. *eg. take it with your trip*
