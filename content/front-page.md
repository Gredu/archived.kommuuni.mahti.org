Community of Kontula is a home for five people. The diversity of residents is high, people with different culture and background. This has been very richening experience, although it has bring up some very interesting challenges. It might be very hard to know what behaviors are cultural and what are personal and therefor setting right rules is not always an easy task.

This web page is an attempt to get residents to understand these differences and help them integrate more easily to the community and to the Finnish society. Also some residents are living alone from their parents for the first time, so there are lot to learn. A hub of information that is easily accessible is needed.

## Goal
Community of Kontula has only two goals for its residents:

  - Wellbeing of a single person
  - Wellbeing of Community as a group

These two rules are equally important. Balancing them is hard and they can be contradicted. Also for some person "wellbeing" can mean different things.


To achieve our goals, we have chosen that the form of government in our Community is is based on responsibilities. Each resident is given a responsibility and ability to make rules. We try to keep rules minimum, and we trust more of person's own morale and ethic. This will hopefully also strengthen the trust between residents.

## We are green
Every resident in community is obligated to be green. This means recycling and moderate usage of water and electricity. More in [Green and Recycling]({{< ref "/guide/green-and-recycling.md" >}}) section.

## How to read this web page?
Everything written in *italic* is usually an explanation. You don't have to read them if you just agree to follow the rules without breaking them. You can break the rules if you understand the reason why the rule exist, and by breaking the rule, you don't actually break the fundamental reason of why that rule exist.

Rules are just something to free you from thinking too deep. The reason why the rule exist is something you should follow.

*eg. There is a rule written in the washing powder, that it should be kept closed. Underlying reason for this, is that moisture doesn't get in. It will get spoiled. It can also get lumpy, which will plug up the washing machine and the soap injection will be weaken.*

*But the rule is simple and the underlying reason for its existence may not actually protect moisture from getting in. You could use the measuring cup for measuring water and then put the wet cup back to the washing powder pack and then close the lid. You have successfully followed the rule but there is now moisture in the washing soap.*

*How about if all rules would be the same as underlying reason? Firstly, too much information. Secondly - if we take the previous example again - you could write "Don't let moisture in", instead of "Keep closed". Now residents would have to understand that if you have lid open, then you'll let moisture in, which is something not everyone may not understand. It is too complicated, and you have to think a little too deep.*

*If reason is fully understood, it may protect from something we haven't even thought of, something that by simply stating rules will never cover.*

It is recommend to read explanations and take some time thinking them. You could actually come up with better rule, since no rule exist for no reason. Also your life can get more easy as you know when to break the rules.

## Recommended read order

Read all **Rules**. Only read **Guides** if you need some help or someone has implicitly referred you to. You should read [psychology]({{< ref "/guide/psychology.md" >}}) though.
