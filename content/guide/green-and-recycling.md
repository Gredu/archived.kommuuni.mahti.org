Kitchen and house warehouse have drop point of different recycling items. When drop point is full, you can take them to the vestibule. Next one who goes out can take those garbages or recycles with him or her to the final point.

Bio has its own rule. **You may not put bio to the vestibule and wait someone to take them!** *It will start to stink. Most people don't want to take bio and that is why it has special rule.*

## Recycling

Following items can be recycled in the general garbage drop point just next to our out door. All items are collected in kitchen.

  - carton
  - glass
  - metal
  - paper
  - bio

Garbage drop point is also for the regular garbage that can not be recycled.

Metal and glass is on the same basket. They have to be separated before recycling. *It seems to be hard for people to separate glass and metal, so we just put them together and separate them later.*

Other recycling items that you have to take somewhere else are:

  - battery
  - electronic
  - clothes
  - bottles with deposit

Battery drop point is located in the kitchen. Drop point of electronic and clothes are located in the house warehouse.

You can take batteries to S-market and K-market in the shopping mall. Clothes can be taken to the recycling point that is located next to the clinic. If you want to recycle your clothes, they have to be in good condition. If they are not, just throw them to the garbage.

Electronics can be recycled in Gigantti, which is in It√§keskus.

Twice a year there will be a big garbage container in our yard. That is when you can throw away stuff that are hard to or illegal to throw on our regular garbage. For example furnitures.

## Bottles with deposit
If bottle doesn't have a deposit and is plastic, it goes to garbage. If it is metal, it goes to metal recycling.

If a bottle has a deposit, it will go to deposit recycling point. Usually bottle is marked with deposit tag or text if it has some deposit.

*In Finland there are three major market that you can take your bottles to. S- and K-group and then there is Lidl and Alko.*

**Take all bottles to Lidl.** It is the easiest way. Lidl accepts bottles from all. Alko, S- and K-group might not accept some bottles.

If you are not sure if bottle has a deposit, read the bottle. Usually there is some kind of note of it. Although all Alko bottles have deposit even if it doesn't say so (means all wines, whiskey, rums, etc.).

All money from deposit will go to Community Bank. You'll have to give the money and the receipt from the deposit to **Greatman**.

## Bio
Throw only food waste to the bio. No plastic of any sort (no packaging plastic!). More information can be found at [HSY](https://www.hsy.fi/en/residents/sorting/instructions/biowaste/Pages/default.aspx).

Emptying bio is a [common task]({{< ref "/rule/common-tasks.md" >}}).

Few things that can save water, electricity and your time:

  - Always use washing machine with full loads
