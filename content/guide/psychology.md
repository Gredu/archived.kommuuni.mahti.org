There was already a good example of how rule are set. There is two level of rule. A rule itself and the underlying reason why that rule exist. For community, it is better that you understand the reason behind the rule, and that you will not just blindly follow the rule. You may always break the rule, but never the reason behind the rule.

Another good example is a man who is walking his dog. Dog has no idea why it is on the leash. There are lots of interesting and fun things to do but the man restricts it. For the man, it is also not very pleasant. It would be nice to let the dog just run freely. Now both suffer.

Community is govern by responsibilities. So you all learn to be the man who walks the dog. Restrict for safety and wellbeing.

Community has some rules, which sometimes you may not understand. It may feel like it is just against you and restricts your freedom. Seek to understand the reasons behind everything.

## Community as one
Community can't order everyone to be friends with each other, but it can help to make friendship possible. Here is a few examples:

 - Parties
 - Watching movies in the living room
 - Eat and make food together
 - Having a sauna together

It is really up to residents if they use these.

### Don't isolate
Usually people isolate them self, because they don't want to bother other. However, this is a wrong way of thinking. When you isolate yourself, most people think that you hate them. So your way of isolating yourself is usually misunderstood.

You should never close the kitchen door. Only close the door if you have burned something in the kitchen and you are trying to avoid smoke from spreading.

Keeping the kitchen door open makes it feels open for everyone. Kitchen has plenty of room for people to dine or even cook at the same time.

Kitchen door is not the only thing you can use to isolate yourself. You could isolate your self with other ways too, like being on the phone, reading, etc.

### Higher negative impact
A study showed that your own detached hair doesn't bother you as much as stranger's one. Same goes to any trash. **Your own trash or unwashed dishes doesn't bother you much, but others they bother more. You have to understand that.**

Clean up your mess!

*This is one of the reasons why you have to take unwashed dishes to your own room.*

### Communication
Best communication happens when it is not forced. That happens when you are just chit chatting. Community and you may get many great benefits of it:

 - Know where are the best offer of something (fruits, meats, etc.)
 - Perhaps there is something we should party?
 - Someone is going somewhere and you could get a ride?
 - Plan new rules for Community
 - Declare new or remove [Free For All]({{< ref "/rule/free-for-all.md" >}}) items?

Many times you just want something and you just didn't know that everyone wanted the same thing. With Community power, we can do more and more cheaper.

Isolation kills the communication.

## The Evil Person
A true evil is very rare. If you ever see one, you probably can't recognize it. Instead it is very likely that you believe he, she or it is in a side of good. Most of the time we misunderstand laziness, stupidity and self centered as an evil. They are also very intertwined and are sometimes very hard to reason separately. Usually person is not aware if he or she is lazy, stupid or self centered. 

This is a guide to improve your social skills in the community. Most of these skills can be used outside of the community, but this guide is specially meant for the community living. There are some reading suggestions in the end of this article if you are more interested in self improvement and leadership.

*This is under construct.*

### Lazy
Laziness can be separated to physical and mental laziness, but we now talking only the mental laziness. Your mind can cleverly play against you if you are mentally lazy. It may make you not see how dirty everything is around you so you would not need to do anything. Lazy person sees a trash bin but he or she never thinks it is full.

Lazy person doesn't want to take trash out, because it is heavy, or because he or she is too busy or hurry. These are all reason that lazy person has created so he or she doesn't need to work. Even small task are hard to do.

Lazy person may think that it is not her or his turn to do it, but everyone else should do it. This is when lazy person gets some trait from the self centered personality. Also a person is lazy for a long time, he or she also becomes stupid, because getting yourself to learn new things requires a lot of mental power.

Lazy person is unable to make an initiative and therefor is bad for doing leadership.

### Stupid
Stupidity is usually a choice. Or actually a default consequence if you don't make a choice. A choice is very easy. You make things that increase your intelligent or you do things that don't.

Stupid person forgets a lot. He or she forgets to empty the recyclables even if he or she would have plenty of mental power to do it. He or she has also have hard time learning new skills. Stupid person doesn't like to learn new skills and usually gets frustrated very fast.

If you stay stupid long time, you become self centered. You simply don't understand what you don't understand.

### Self centered
Usually self centered people think that everyone owns them something. Or that everyone should be interested on what they are doing. Usually self centered person thinks that they are good people, and for them it is very easy to appear as a good person.

When self centered person completes a task, they evaluate that task too high. They make a small favor and require a big favor. They are not afraid to ask favor and they usually don't value very high since they think that they are deserved to be served.

Self centered can be lazy too if she or he gets favor from other people too easily. Also self centered person may think that they don't need to do anything because they are good persons. This is actually more originated from a lazy person's mind as it tries to find out reasons to not work.

Self centered is not good in taking critique and he or she becomes stupid. Most people see that you should not try to tell her or his flaw, but to just ignore her or him.

Self loving is not the same as self centered, but they are very close. Self centered can be associated with mostly negative things, but self loving can be associated with both good and bad things.

## How to not be lazy, stupid and self centered a.k.a evil
It is important that you are not lazy, stupid or self centered, because those are the traits that make you look like a mean or evil person. If you know that have these traits, but you are not willing to change anything, at least to try miditate the bad effects.

In this article we try to make you not appear as a mean or evil person.

### How to not be lazy
The answer is not to be hard-working. Reason for lazyness is usually because you have low mental power. Mental power is something that most of us have finite amount. It will run out during the day.

You can get more by doing meditation pratices. But to bypass low mental power more quickly is to create habits. Your brain loves habits and when it gets to it, it actually doesn't use mental power. However, creating a habit may take more mental power, but it is worth investigating.

For example, when you put something in the trash, you automatically check if it is full, and if it is, then you empty it and bring the bag to the vestibule. During that operation your brain simple doesn't become self aware that it is work. **You just do it.** No pauses, no self doupt, it just happens. This is how habits trick you to become more not lazy.

If you ever wonder how some people can work so hard, it is mainly because they have build good habits. Their brain doesn't fight back, it just forgets it is doing work.

Now habits sound like a wonder, but it in most cases it does fight against you. There can be bad habits, and those are very hard to erase. Brain loves habits. It creates them by strengthening neuroconnection. More you do something, more it becomes automatic (a habit) and then it doesn't need mental power.

### How not to be stupid
This is also related to habits. What you do when you get home from work, or what you usually do when you have free time? Are you watching TV or some media? Are you just entertaining yourself?

An intelligent person finds joy on learning something. To become more intelligent, use your free time on learning something that brings you joy. It can be anything. As long as it requires you to think and learn. If you can manage to do that your in the up spiral. Usually if you are so intensively learning something, you don't want anyone to distract you, not TV or music or anything.

Most common things that makes person stupid is excessive use of media (TV, Youtube, etc) and music. Most of the video games are bad for you. You may think that playing some simple puzzle games may make you smarter. They mostly don't because the area of expertise is too low. The area of problems is too narrow. However games that are very complex are good for you eg. chess.

A good practice is actually limit yourself of doing something unnecessary and then just wait if you start to do something usefull. Close your TV or any media source. Don't listen music. Don't eat any sweet. What will you do then? What ever you start to do, don't do it if it is not something that requires learning. When you finally find the thing that you are naturally orientated to learn and that is something you find joy doing so, then do it. Intelligent person is someone who naturally starts to learn when she or he has free time.

Reminding you that being intelligent is not something you do absolute. Sometimes it is something useless, but most of the time it is something usefull.

### How not to be self centered
Self centered person is usually depressed or are mentally unstable, sometimes having great days and next day can be worst. This is because they are very self aware of their emotion. Usually they actually like powerful emotions, feeling that they are more live and sometimes even more right on some issue. Even if they are wrong, they can think they are right if the emotions are too high. It is not good that one day you smile and then next day you don't. Other people may think that you are not trustworthy.

Be stable. Do more meditation. You should not be controlled by emotion, you should be one who is controlling your own brain. Emotions are good, but you should be the master of your own body.

When you meet people, try to think what she or he wants, what is her or his wishes and dreams and fears. Can you help him or her? Should you help her or him? Get your thoughts of yourself of what you want. When you do that long time, you actually starts to see how stupid your own problems are. And how stupid other peoples problems are.

There is a saying that man's value can be measured by the size of his problems. Thinking of when you get home from work or school so you can see your lover, watch TV or play PC games is very low level of problem. Also thinking if one likes you or not is very low.

If you are responsible of others ability to support themself and their family, then you have medium level of problems. If you are responsible of life of another, future of your people or the whole world, then you have high level problem.

There are more levels than low, medium and high. Levels don't really exist like this, but they are good way of demonstrating how it works.

So... What is the level your problem? What is your responsibilities in life? Who gave you that responsibility and why? And ultimately what would you do if you don't have responsibility?
