The full notebook guide for the washing machine can be found in one of the shelf in the living room.

**Keep the powder pack closed all the time to avoid moisture getting in!** *Else the moisture will get in. Powder will start to cluster and get spoiled. Clustered powder might stuck the washing machine and the quality of laundry is going to be bad. If that happens, the wrong solution is to add more powder. You should open the slots where you put your powder and clean it.*

## Washing programs
There are only two programs you mostly use when washing laundry. Mostly you split your laundry to be washed in 60 Celsius or 40 Celsius. Usually bed sheets goes to 60 Celsius and normal clothes to 40 Celsius. Each laundry or clothe has a small tag which tells you how it should be washed.

So two programs you mostly use are ecology 60 Celsius and fast 40 Celsius for textiles. If you wash the green carpet on the bathroom, you should just use the normal 40 Celsius that is located just on top of ecology 60 Celsius.

If your clothes are very dirty, use the normal 40 Celsius. That program is located just under the normal 60 Celsius program.

For laundry that requires more special treatment, check the notebook for more washing programs.

## Washing powder
**One spoon of washing powder is enough** (spoon is inside the powder pack). Sometimes if your clothes are dirty or you wash community laundry, then you may want to put two spoons of powders.

Put powder to the section that reads II. There are two other sections, but they are not too important.

*If you are very interested in washing laundry you should already know everything that is written in this section anyway. This section contains only the bare minimum to you to be able to wash your laundry. Additional slots is for those who want to use chemical that makes your laundry more soft and have some odor. The slot I is for pre-washing, which is rarely used. If you need to use that, you have to tell the machine to use pre-washing program.*


## Drying
We have a drying rooms in the cellar. The rooms 27 and 32 are rooms you have to reserve. You will find the calendar book in the laundry room just between the rooms 27 and 32.

A third drying room is in the end of the hallway. That room does not require reserving. A laundry room also has a drying machine which you can use without reservation.

Usually some drying rooms are free so there is no need to reserve beforehand. Just go there, and if you see rooms 27 and 32 free, just mark the time how long you want to use them.

## Clothes stinks even after the washing
Sunk your clothes to a vinegar and let them be for a while. Wash them again in the washing machine. Vinegar can be found in the shower room. *Vinegar is not common consumable. What is left there is free for use, but no more will be bought.*

If you leave your clothes too long without drying them, they will start to stink. You'll have to wash them again.

*They stink because germs multiply in moistures. Almost always when something stinks it is because of the germs.*

## Sustainable washing
**Wash laundry with full loads.** It is better for the environment and you are obligated to be [green]({{< ref "/guide/green-and-recycling.md">}}). If you are not able to get full loads, full fill with public laundry. They are located in a basket on the shower room. Public laundry are all 60 Celsius. However, the green carpet in the shower room should be washed in 40 Celsius normal program. More information of [common tasks]({{< ref "/rule/common-tasks.md">}}).
