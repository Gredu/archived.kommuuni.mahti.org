There are two drying area. One for small things like fork, knife and spoons (a cup). Other is for kettles, plates etc (in the shelf). If they are full and dry, you have to empty them. That is a [common task]({{< ref "/rule/common-tasks.md" >}}).

Sometimes drying area is full of dishes that have not yet dried. Then you just need to use (and only then!) area that is not a drying area *eg. kitchen table*. **Never dry anything on the oven.** *It causes corrosion.*

*Corrosion happens when liquid and oxygen touches a metal. To be more precise, you need three elements together: metal (like iron), oxygen (usually from atmosphere) and an electrolyte (usually water).*

Be never too lazy to make a room in the drying area for yourself, if dishes are dry and there is no room.

When you have to dry kettles or pans on a non-drying area that is flat, dry it **upside down with an air gap**. Makes sure air can "touch" the kettle or pan from every direction.

*Drying is vaporisation. Vaporisation happens when liquid molecules are in touch with an air. A moving air would intensify the vaporisation.*

Here is a few pictures of what **you should not do**:

And here how it is done right:

**Make sure there is an air gap!**

**Do not put wet kettles or pans to shelf.**

*Moisture is where germs like to multiply.*
